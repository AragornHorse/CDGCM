# CDGCM: A Cheap Dynamic Gesture Controled Music Framework

## What's CDGCM
  CDGCM is a cheap dynamic-gesture-controled-music framework. We provide several reasonable models writen in pytorch, as well as their training code. You can convinently download them for your own projects.

## What're the models used to classify gestures
* ResNet-LSTM
* ResNet-Attention
* ResNet-Bert
* ResNet
* LSTM2D
* ResNet3D

## What else
* A ResNet-LSTM to recognize whether a gesture happened
* A ResNet to recognize whether the user appears
* A fft module to reduce noise
* Several filters to reduce noise
